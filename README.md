# Arena Master

#### A Laser Tag Arena Management Suite

This is the development branch.

## What's It About?

Arena Master's aim is to be a suite of interconnected app screens that function as a singular app, in order to simplify the operation of a laser tag arena. 

Though there's no release yet, we hope it will happen for Windows, Mac, and Linux-based systems (RHEL, Ubuntu Desktop, Debian, and Mind ... with other flavors being considered).

## List of (Future) Features

At this moment, it's vaporware. But here's the list of components we'd like to see:

* Brand management
  * Locations and affiliates
  * Multiple products under each brand
* Arena management
  * Planning
  * Mapping
  * Incidient reports
  * Maintenance
  * Multiple arenas per location
* Equipment management
  * Check in/out
  * Damage reporting
  * Maintenace and work orders
  * Parts inventory for repairs
* Team management
  * Qualification for competition
  * Membership management
    * Team leader access via web/mobile app (much MUCH later)
* Player memberships
* Gift card generation & redemption
* PoS (with isolation from other functionality on a per-machine or per-login basis)

And a LOT more than that.

All of it, managed from within the app.

I do hope this isn't biting off more than we can chew.
